## Portable Content like never before.

These two cards use the same file for content. They simply have a different wrapper, which because of the power of MDX has total control of how the elements are rendered.

<div class="flex gap-2 flex-wrap [perspective:900px] overflow-visible">
  <Card markdown={technonomicon} />

  <CardHolo markdown={technonomicon} />
</div>
