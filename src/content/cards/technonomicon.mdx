  # The Technonomicon makes stitching content together simple.

  You can take pieces of content and create some frankenstein-esque villianous blog. At least, that is what I did.
  Here is a whole article I wrote about it. Well not the whole article, just the stuff not contained in a `More` tag.

  <div class="border p-6">
    <MarkdownSnippet
      markdown={technonomicon}
      href={`/articles/${technonomicon.slug}`}
      cta="Read More"
    />
  </div>

  There are a few tags that are important to the Technonomicon, and `More` might be the most important of all.

  The contents of a `More` tag can be discarded, by rendering `More` as `Empty`
